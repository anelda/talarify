#Building sustainable computational research communities in South Africa and beyond

##Summary
Recent technological advances in a wide array of research fields have enabled researchers to generate much more data at lower costs than ever before.  A specific development that immediately springs to mind is that of next generation sequencing (NGS), which allows researchers to sequence millions of nucleotides in a single run.  NGS has been applied in research focusing on human disease and health, food scarcity, environmental protection, crime combatting, climate change, and even consumer satisfaction.  The immediate effect of this ability to generate large amounts of data has now become very clear â€“ researchers in all fields need to be equipped with computational skills to handle large data sets.
The need 
Around the world several programmes has been established to address the critical need to train researchers, specifically those from traditionally non-computational backgrounds such as medicine, biology, and the humanities.  One such an initiative is the Software Carpentry Foundation (SCF) established in 2014 but building on work done by Software Carpentry (SCW) founder Greg Wilson and volunteers since 1995.  The SCF is a non-profit organisation that aims to teach basic computing skills to all researchers early in their careers.
