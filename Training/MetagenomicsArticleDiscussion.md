####Infant Gut Microbiota and Food Sensitizations: Associations in the first year of life
#####Azad et al. 2015. Clinical & Experimental Allergy, 45, 632-643. (doi:10.1111/cea.12487)

##### Aims of study:

* Is food sensitization at 1 year associated with prior/concurrent gut microbiota composition and diversity?
* Do these associations exist in the absence of major established early life risk factors for microbiota dysbiosis?


##### Study design:

* 166 infants from longitudinal study
* Selection of infants:
  * First 166 with faecal sample at 3 months & 1 year
  * Complete results for allergy skin prick test at 1 year

* Mothers completed questionnaire at 3, 6, 12 months postpartum
  * *Possible problems with questionnaires?*
  * *Whom in the discussion have used questionnaires?*
  * *What software do you use to capture questionnaire responses?*


  * Infant - food, allergies, rash, medication, diet, pets, etc
  * Mode of delivery (hospital records)
  * Antibiotic exposure - mom report (direct/indirect)

##### Sample prep:

* Let's take a look at what is reported - do you have all this information available about your own samples for when it is time to write up?
* How do you associate data with metadata?
* What about controlled vocabularies?
* Example: Cornell University's [guide to writing "readme" style metadata](http://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme)

##### 16S data analysis:

* What does rarified mean?
* See "Waste not, want not: Why rarefying microbiome data is inadmissible" by McMurdie & Holmes, Plos Computational Biology. DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003531. 2014
	* high rate of false positives
	* discard samples that can be clustered accurately by alternative methods
