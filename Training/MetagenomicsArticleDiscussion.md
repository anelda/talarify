####Infant Gut Microbiota and Food Sensitizations: Associations in the first year of life
#####Azad et al. 2015. Clinical & Experimental Allergy, 45, 632-643. (doi:10.1111/cea.12487)

##### Aims of study:

* Is food sensitization at 1 year associated with prior/concurrent gut microbiota composition and diversity?
* Do these associations exist in the absence of major established early life risk factors for microbiota dysbiosis?


##### Study design:

* 166 infants from longitudinal study
* Selection of infants:
  * First 166 with faecal sample at 3 months & 1 year
  * Complete results for allergy skin prick test at 1 year

* Mothers completed questionnaire at 3, 6, 12 months postpartum
  * *Possible problems with questionnaires?*
  * *Whom in the discussion have used questionnaires?*
  * *What software do you use to capture questionnaire responses?*


  * Infant - food, allergies, rash, medication, diet, pets, etc
  * Mode of delivery (hospital records)
  * Antibiotic exposure - mom report (direct/indirect)

##### Sample prep:

* Let's take a look at what is reported - do you have all this information available about your own samples for when it is time to write up?
* How do you associate data with metadata?
* What about controlled vocabularies?
* Example: Cornell University's [guide to writing "readme" style metadata](http://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme)

##### 16S data analysis:

* What does rarefied mean?
* See "Waste not, want not: Why rarefying microbiome data is inadmissible" by McMurdie & Holmes, Plos Computational Biology. DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003531. 2014
	* high rate of false positives
	* discard samples that can be clustered accurately by alternative methods

##### Statistical analysis:

* How do you decide which statistical tests to use?
* How comfortable are you with using various statistical tests?
* Where can you get help?

##### Results:

* Infants with food sensitization at 1 yr had lower gut microbiota richness (stat signif) and diversity (not stat signif) at 3 months
* No difference in richness or diversity at 1 yr
* Composition differed by sensitization status at 3 months and 1 year
	* Enterobacteriaceae overrepresented among sensitized infants at both ages
	* Bacteroidaceae underrepresented
	* Sensitized infants at 1 year - lower relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae
	* Relative abundance of Clostridia was comparable between sensitized & non-sensitized infants
* At 3 months a quartile increase in richness -> associated with 52% reduction in risk for food sensitization by 1 year
* Quartile increase in E/B ratio -> associated with ~2 fold increase in risk for food sensitization
* At 1 year richness wasn't associated with food sensitization any longer, although composition was

* Adjustment for potentially disruptive events lead to no change in findings
* Small changes when correcting for breastfeeding

##### Discussion:

* "...illustrate the need for caution (and consideration for timing) when interpreting summary measures of richness and diversity for clinical application."
* "This apparant contradiction may be a function of taxonomic resolution..."
* "...elevated Enterobacteriaceae may be a marker for eczema...increase risk for food sensitization."
* "...food sensitization at age 1 was more likely in infants with low levels of Ruminococcaceae..."
* "...delayed maturation of the gut microbiota may be a predictor of atopic disease."

##### Weaknesses:

* Parent reported food allergy diagnosis did not agree with skin prick results
* Low prevalence of food sensitization precluded some statistical analysis
	* *Can this data be re-used in other studies to increase sample size?*
